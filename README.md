# REACT Gallery

## Description

_Duration: 7 hours_

Today I had a list of photos and didn't have anywhere to post them. I wanted a feature where my friends can like each photo and keep track of how many people have done so. Lastly, I wanted to create separate React components to separate information. I created this web application with my new React.js skills!
